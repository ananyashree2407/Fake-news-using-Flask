# Fake-news-using-Flask
A datamining project that used various Machine Learning Algorithms to classify the various news collected from the real world as real or fake to protect the readers from getting scammed by fake news. It has a research paper associated with it written for the SET conference in VIT Vellore. 
The various Algorithms prefered for the study are PA Classifier, Decision Tree, Logisitic Regression 
The various measures that are taken into consderations for measuring are accuracy, AUC ROC, F-1 Score.
PA classifier proved to emerge as the best from the among the various algorithms that were worked on
